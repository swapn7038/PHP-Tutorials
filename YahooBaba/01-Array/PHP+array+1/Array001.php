// We can store value in any variable. 
// For example we want to store 10 in a variable. We can 
// initialize a variable and assign value to it. 

// Now suppose we want to store multiple values. 
// Then we have to take multiple variables, but thats not the right way to do it. 

// If we take 100 variables to store an 100 values, then our code will be very long. 
// So we here concept of an array comes in game. 

// Simply putting an square bracket's we cak add multiple values in the array. 

// We cannot put double quotes for taking values, 
// because double inverted quotes will make values in string. 
// Ex : $var = "10, 20, 30"; this is string

// And in php we can add multiple types of data in an array. 
// Ex : We can take float, string, integer and other data types in single array.

// Elements la access karnyasathi aaplya kade, index astat, jya prakare aaplya class madhe pratek 
// student kad roll number astat, tasach array madhalya elements la ek ek indes assign zalela asto.
// Indexing starts from 0


// We took $colors array here. and with $colors[0] statement we can access the first element of an array. 

// We took 0 in square bracket because indexing starts from 0 in computers, or in an array.
