I have 4 folders for an array here.

1. Array+main contains notes from website. Ex : w3school .
2. Array+practive contains array function from Yahoo Baba.
3. PHP+array+1 and PHP+array+2 contains proper notes from Yahoo baba.

After watching half videos of Yahoo baba, I realized I was not taking notes in proper format.
I should have created separate folder for single program.

So after that I created PHP+array+1 & PHP+array+2 for arrays.
