# PHP Project CMS => News Blog Website

What is CMS
-> Content Management System.

--> Whenever we make any dynamic website, there are two parts of the website.
--> Front-end & Back-end
--> Front-end is for visitors.
--> Back-end is password protected. Only the owner of an website, with the help of name & password can login & can have access the pages of the website. Usi ko ham control panel bolte he.

Control panel websites ke pages ko control kar sakta he.
With control panel, we can add new pages, can change content, logo, theme, colors, create users.
