Best studying method
-> Write everything at one place, from starting. Like I did for php. It doesnt took me long to learn php. Within 1.5 month I learn a lot of php topics.
Many times I thought of quittingm but I did not, and here now I am good at php.

One more thig, there are lecture / tutorial / website notes in this folder. While studying the new topic, write down explanation in your language, like whatever Please write you understand. In hindi or english or marathi.

config.php
-> What we were doing is that we was passig same code again & again. But what if we have to change the username, password or maybe server name. Then we have to go to every file & change the name, password & server name.
Solution to this problem is we can make one file named as congif.php, we will write common code here which we were using for db connection, query and connection close.
config stands for configuration.
